#### For my programmer friends:  ---> 
```java  
//guess the language! (hint: it's the first real programming language I learned)
public class aboutMe{  
  public static void main(String[] args) {  
    String name = "Kayley Seow";
    String[] whoIAm = {"programmer", "engineer", "musician", "feminist", "student"};
    double grade = 12.0;
    String pronouns = "she/her/hers";
    boolean tabs = true;
  }  
}  
```  
**A Translation:**  
I'm Kayley, a high school senior, a self-proclaimed jack of all trades, master of none. After being introduced to java in [APCSA](https://github.com/kayleyseow/APCSA) about a year ago, I brought it upon myself to learn as much as I could about programming‚Äîso far, I've self taught myself C/C++ for an [Arduino project](https://github.com/kayleyseow/Digital-Ruler), learned [HTML/CSS/JS](https://github.com/kayleyseow/SHEQUALITY) after being selected for [Twitter‚Äôs SIP Cohort](https://twitter.com/womeng/status/1296530930463580161), taken [SQL](https://github.com/kayleyseow/SQL-for-Data-Science) and [MATLAB](https://github.com/kayleyseow/Introduction-to-Programming-with-MATLAB) courses for fun, joined [Hack Club](https://github.com/hackclub), and even discovered [React.js](https://codepen.io/kayleyseow/pen/QWyzBWd) with my amazing mentor. My Github is living proof, as almost every line of code I‚Äôve ever written is saved here. My journey is just beginning, and I hope you‚Äôll be able to join me. 

If you want to reach me, I'm on the Hack Club slack and Kaggle as ```kayley```, and basically everywhere else as ```kayleyseow```. Some of my repos are private, but feel free to look around!
