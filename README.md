#### For my programmer friends:  
```java  
//guess the language! (hint: it's the first real programming language I learned)
public class aboutMe{  
  public static void main(String[] args) {  
    String name = "Kayley Seow";
    String[] whoIAm = {"programmer", "engineer", "musician", "feminist", "student"};
    double grade = 12.0;
    String pronouns = "she/her/hers";
    boolean tabs = true;
  }  
}  
```  
#### A Translation:  
I'm Kayley, a high school senior who is a programmer, engineer at heart, musician (flutist/pianist, in fact!), avid feminist, a lifelong learner but most of all, a proclaimed jack of all trades, master of none‚Äîafter being introduced to programming about a year ago, I brought it upon myself to learn as much as I could about the world of CS. My Github is living proof, almost every line of code I‚Äôve ever written is saved here. My journey is just beginning, and I hope you‚Äôll be able to join me. 

If you want to reach me, I'm on the Hack Club slack and Kaggle as ```kayley```, Twitter as ```kayleyseow_```, and almost everywhere else as ```kayleyseow```.
