# Kayley's Failure Resume  
**TOC: [Intro](https://github.com/kayleyseow/kayleyseow/blob/master/FailureResume.md#intro), [2020](https://github.com/kayleyseow/kayleyseow/blob/master/FailureResume.md#2020), 2019, 2018, 2017**
### Intro:
- What's a failure résumé?  
  - A failure résumé is known by many names: anti-resume, anti-portfolio, or CV of failures. The overarching idea is the same, though. **By keeping track of your failures and reflecting on them in a way that's constructive, you can learn from your mistakes and achieve more in the future.**
- Why did you decide to make one?  
  - I decided to make a "failure resume" because I feel its important for me to be able to **look at my past failures in a positive light**, and be able to **learn from them** at the same time.
- Fun Fact: The idea of an "anti-resume" actually originated from acedemia!
- Fun Fact 2: The word "unfortunately" is mentioned in my email inbox an _astounding 83 times!_ (don't worry, not all are rejections!)  
- TL;DR: Don't be afraid to fail
